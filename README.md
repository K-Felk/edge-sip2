## Overview

The purpose of this edge API is to bridge the gap between self service
circulation and patron services stations and FOLIO by allowing these systems to
issue requests and receive responses in Standard Interchange Protocol v2 (SIP2).
These requests will be serviced by FOLIO APIs and the responses will be based on
FOLIO results for all supported (TBD) SIP2 commands.

## Security

TBD (most likely stunnel)

## Configuration

TBD

## Additional information
